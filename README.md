By 2030, the Clean Power Plan could save the United States $20 billion in climate-related costs and deliver up to $34 billion in health benefits.
- [UK Government: Act now on the Climate Emergency](https://secure.greenpeace.org.uk/page/s/declare-climate-emergency) - Now that Parliament has declared a Climate Emergency, we need you to act like it. For starters, that means banning all new oil and gas production in the UK, including fracking, tripling renewable energy by 2030, planting 700 million trees, introducing a Frequent Flyer Tax, ending the sale of all new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and more.

About [1,000 dams have failed](https://apnews.com/75b1cd657f3e4fa3be6adaf968eb7df4) over the past four decades, killing 34 people, and now many are no longer adequate to handle the intense rainfall and floods of a changing climate.  
With dams causing wild salmon populations to go extinct, their only benefit is hydropower, yet dams are woefully inefficient by modern standards. For example, the Tugalo Dam in Georgia destroyed 597 acres of temperate rainforest to produce 45 Megawatts, which is the equivalent of 7,500 homes adding 6kw rooftop solar panels. We should tear down these damns as soon as possible, be that when their contract runs out or sooner, instead of wasting tax-payer money operating them or trying to revive them.
