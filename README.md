- [EU: Right to Repair](https://repair.eu/) - Cracked screens, weak batteries, broken charging ports... We’d like to fix them, but instead we end up buying a new smartphone because repairs are too expensive, difficult or impossible. Reducing the lifespan of a product may drive sales, but this comes at the expense of consumers, workers and the planet. Ask the European Union to give people the Right to Repair by requiring manufacturers to design repairable smartphones and provide spare parts and repair information to all repairers and consumers.

Now a misguided plan to feed the starving whales with hatchery salmon will push both endangered species closer to the edge, while costing taxpayers millions of dollars per year.
Tell NOAA Regional Administrator Barry Thom, WDFW Director Kelly Susewind, and our elected decision makers to stop wasting money on failed plans and invest in science-based solutions: reduce hatchery production, remove dams and change how we harvest salmon.

- [The Green Flying Duty](https://www.responsiblevacation.com/copy/write-to-politicians) - The UK is one of the few countries to tax aviation fuel, but it is too low, and not ringfenced for climate solutions. The Green Flying Duty proposal is a reformed version of the UK's APD, that will be ring-fenced for Research and Development (R&D) in electric aviation and to improve railway connectivity. Suggest this to politicians worldwide.
- [U.K. Double Tree Cover](https://act.friendsoftheearth.uk/petition/tell-uk-government-double-tree-cover) - Over the centuries the United Kingdom has cleared its forests, leaving it with some of the lowest levels of woodland in Europe. If the government is serious about protecting the climate, it needs to bring back the lost trees.
- [U.S. Gas-powered car free by 2040](https://www.curbed.com/2019/5/21/18632816/zero-emission-vehicles-act-ban-cars) - Federal legislation was proposed in both the House of Representatives and the Senate that could radically shift the way the U.S. tackles its climate crisis. The Zero-Emission Vehicles Act would eliminate the sale of gas-powered passenger cars in the U.S. by 2040.
- [U.S. Save the "Clean Power Plan"](https://www.nrdc.org/save-clean-power-plan) - Fossil-fueled power plants are responsible for nearly 40 percent of America’s carbon footprint. The Clean Power Plan calls for setting limits on this climate-warming pollution from these power plants, specifically at least 32 percent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. By 2030, the Clean Power Plan could save the United States $20 billion in climate-related costs and deliver up to $34 billion in health benefits.
- [UK Government: Act now on the Climate Emergency](https://secure.greenpeace.org.uk/page/s/declare-climate-emergency) - Now that Parliament has declared a Climate Emergency, we need you to act like it. For starters, that means banning all new oil and gas production in the UK, including fracking, tripling renewable energy by 2030, planting 700 million trees, introducing a Frequent Flyer Tax, ending the sale of all new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and more.

- [US Damn Removal](https://www.change.org/t/dam-removal-en-us) - [70 percent of the dams in the United States](https://www.ussdams.org/our-news/americas-aging-dams-in-need-of-repair/) are now more than 50 years old, with almost 2,000 of them rated as "high-hazard". About [1,000 dams have failed](https://apnews.com/75b1cd657f3e4fa3be6adaf968eb7df4) over the past four decades, killing 34 people, and now many are no longer adequate to handle the intense rainfall and floods of a changing climate.
With dams causing wild salmon populations to go extinct, their only benefit is hydropower, yet dams are woefully inefficient by modern standards. For example, the Tugalo Dam in Georgia destroyed 597 acres of temperate rainforest to produce 45 Megawatts, which is the equivalent of 7,500 homes adding 6kw rooftop solar panels. We should tear down these dams as soon as possible, be that when their contract runs out or sooner, instead of wasting tax-payer money operating them or trying to revive them.
