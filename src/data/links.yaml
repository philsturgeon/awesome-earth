      story of maverick architect Michael Reynolds, his crew of renegade house
      builders from New Mexico, and their fight to introduce radically different
      ways of living. Imagine a home that heats itself, that provides its own
      water, hat grows its own food. Imagine that it needs no expensive
      technology, that it recycles its own waste, that it has its own power
      source. And now imagine that it can be built anywhere, by anyone, out of
      the things society throws away. Thirty years ago, architect Michael
      Reynolds imagined just such a home - then set out to build it. Reynolds
      believes that in an age of ecological instability and impending natural
      disaster, his buildings can - and will - change the way we live.

However, an overwhelming majority of Alaskan residents are unfamiliar with the details of it's development and implications. Noting the absence of available data, as well as the lack of awareness surrounding the proposal, Bjorn and Kim took on the ground-truth-trekking model of investigative research, and set out to explore some of the unanswered questions from the source. Completing a three-part, 1,000 mile human powered wilderness expedition through the proposed footprint of the mine, they engaged the people that they encountered on the subjects of perpetual waste storage, the significance of subsistence fisheries, the energy demands of a large-scale mine, and the challenges facing rural residents to name a few.

      The use of bamboo significantly reduces deforestation. According to the EPA, one hardwood tree produces approximately 45 kg of toilet paper and about 83 million toilet rolls are produced every day. Bamboo toilet paper production requires less energy, one-fifth of the water, produces considerably more fiber on less land area, generates 30-35% more oxygen than other plants and trees, and it reduces the amount of carbon dioxide by about the same amount.  In addition, the production process requires that water and other materials are collected, reused and recycled. Finally, we invest 25% of our profits to stop deforestation and global warming.

      are now more than 50 years old, with almost 2,000 of them rated as
      "high-hazard". About [1,000 dams have
      failed](https://apnews.com/75b1cd657f3e4fa3be6adaf968eb7df4) over the past
      four decades, killing 34 people, and now many are no longer adequate to
      handle the intense rainfall and floods of a changing climate.

      With dams causing wild salmon populations to go extinct, their only
      benefit is hydropower, yet dams are woefully inefficient by modern
      standards. For example, the Tugalo Dam in Georgia destroyed 597 acres of
      temperate rainforest to produce 45 Megawatts, which is the
      equivalent of 7,500 homes adding 6kw rooftop solar panels. We should tear
      down these damns as soon as possible, be that when their contract runs out
      or sooner, instead of wasting tax-payer money operating them or trying to
      revive them. [More on Last Week Tonight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpzvaqypav8).
