  100% Natural Freeze-Dried Fruit Snacks from Spain and Portugal shipped to you.
  The fruit youâ€™re enjoying would have otherwise gone unused and rotted away on
  the ground. We also think that the name "Rotten" helps bring attention to the
  serious issue of food waste. Delicious, healthy, 100% natural, with a long
  shelf life, our freeze dried fruit snack pouches are ideal for home, work,
  office, to take to school, camping or just about anywhere. Help reduce food
  waste. Help small local farmers. We use 100% compostable packaging and ship
  with your local postal service because it is the lowest carbon footprint
  option.  But reducing carbon emissions is not enough, and we plant trees to
  compensate for our CO2 emissions.
