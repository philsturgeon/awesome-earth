  Wild salmon and southern resident killer whales are on the brink of
  extinction. Now a misguided plan to feed the starving whales with hatchery
  salmon will push both endangered species closer to the edge, while costing
  taxpayers millions of dollars per year.

  Tell NOAA Regional Administrator Barry Thom, WDFW Director Kelly Susewind, and
  our elected decision makers to stop wasting money on failed plans and invest
  in science-based solutions: reduce hatchery production, remove dams and change
  how we harvest salmon.
