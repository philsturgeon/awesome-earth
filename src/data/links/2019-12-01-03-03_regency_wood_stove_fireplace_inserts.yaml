  If solar heating is not an option, wood stove inserts can update your drafty,
  open wood fireplace. They'll send less heat out the chimney, and more heat
  around your house, drastically improving your wood burning efficiency. They
  pump the smoke back into the fire to burn that off too, which sends less crap
  into the atmosphere. Try to use [coffee
  logs](https://www.bio-bean.com/elements/coffee-logs-and-retailers/) instead of
  wood.
