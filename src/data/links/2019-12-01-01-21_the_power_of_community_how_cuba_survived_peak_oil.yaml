description: >-
  A great example of how a community can survive the oil apocalypse. Cubans were
  on the edge of starvation due to the oil crisis - the average Cuban lost 20
  pounds. The Cuban people helped avert disaster from the bottom up by
  reclaiming land everywhere and began growing vegetables on them. Here we see
  the importance of recovering lost knowledge to ensure communal survival.
