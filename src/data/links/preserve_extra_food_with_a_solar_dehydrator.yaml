  A solar food dehydrator is a device that removes moisture from food to aid in
  its preservation. You can [buy a simple
  one](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mixedmediaeng/dryceratop-solar-food-dehydrator-for-mason-jars/description)
  or make your own.  Food drying is a method of preserving fruit, vegetables,
  and animal proteins that has been practiced since antiquity.
