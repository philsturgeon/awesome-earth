  Garbage Warrior is a feature-length documentary film telling the epic story of
  maverick architect Michael Reynolds, his crew of renegade house builders from
  New Mexico, and their fight to introduce radically different ways of living.
  Imagine a home that heats itself, that provides its own water, hat grows its
  own food. Imagine that it needs no expensive technology, that it recycles its
  own waste, that it has its own power source. And now imagine that it can be
  built anywhere, by anyone, out of the things society throws away. Thirty years
  ago, architect Michael Reynolds imagined just such a home - then set out to
  build it. Reynolds believes that in an age of ecological instability and
  impending natural disaster, his buildings can - and will - change the way we
  live.
