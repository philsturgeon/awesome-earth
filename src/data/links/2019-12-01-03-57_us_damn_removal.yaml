  [70 percent of the dams in the United
  States](https://www.ussdams.org/our-news/americas-aging-dams-in-need-of-repair/)
  are now more than 50 years old, with almost 2,000 of them rated as
  "high-hazard". About [1,000 dams have
  failed](https://apnews.com/75b1cd657f3e4fa3be6adaf968eb7df4) over the past
  four decades, killing 34 people, and now many are no longer adequate to handle
  the intense rainfall and floods of a changing climate.

  With dams causing wild salmon populations to go extinct, their only benefit is
  hydropower, yet dams are woefully inefficient by modern standards. For
  example, the Tugalo Dam in Georgia destroyed 597 acres of temperate rainforest
  to produce 45 Megawatts, which is the equivalent of 7,500 homes adding 6kw
  rooftop solar panels. We should tear down these damns as soon as possible, be
  that when their contract runs out or sooner, instead of wasting tax-payer
  money operating them or trying to revive them. [More on Last Week
