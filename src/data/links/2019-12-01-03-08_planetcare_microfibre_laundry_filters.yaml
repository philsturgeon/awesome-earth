  35% of microplastics are fibers that are released when we wash our clothes. 
  With consumer and industrial laundry filters, tackle the problem close to the
  source â€“ with a filter in your washing machine.  PlanteCare makes efficient,
  practical and affordable laundry filters that allow every household to stop
  sending microfibres into the environment.
