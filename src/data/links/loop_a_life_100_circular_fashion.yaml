  This circular textile award winning brand sets the new standard by clothing
  from local raw salvaged materials, recycling them without any chemicals,
  generating no wastewater, recycling their own products at end-of-life,
  researching and developing new ways to develop circular products.  They
  organize local sorting campaigns, workshops, collection campaigns, and
  facilitate other fashion companies in their circular transition.  Each sweater
  saves 500 liters of water, 60mJ of energy, uses zero chemicals, and saves at
  least 6kg of C02 emissions (when compared to traditional manufacturing).
