  Right now, while our planet speeds toward the brink of the climate crisis,
  Microsoft is putting its foot on the accelerator. As oil and gas profits
  continue to fall, giant oil corporations have turned to cloud computing and
  artificial intelligence (AI) to answer their problems. Microsoft promises
  companies like ExxonMobil that its analytical tools and other AI technologies
  will help them discover and pump even more oil at a lower cost. This
  Greenpeace petition will let Microsoft know this is not acceptable.
