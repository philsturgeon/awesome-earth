  Now that Parliament has declared a Climate Emergency, we need you to act like
  it. For starters, that means banning all new oil and gas production in the UK,
  including fracking, tripling renewable energy by 2030, planting 700 million
  trees, introducing a Frequent Flyer Tax, ending the sale of all new petrol and
  diesel cars by 2030, and more.
