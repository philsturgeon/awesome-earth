  The use of bamboo significantly reduces deforestation. According to the EPA,
  one hardwood tree produces approximately 45 kg of toilet paper and about 83
  million toilet rolls are produced every day. Bamboo toilet paper production
  requires less energy, one-fifth of the water, produces considerably more fiber
  on less land area, generates 30-35% more oxygen than other plants and trees,
  and it reduces the amount of carbon dioxide by about the same amount.  In
  addition, the production process requires that water and other materials are
  collected, reused and recycled. Finally, we invest 25% of our profits to stop
  deforestation and global warming.
