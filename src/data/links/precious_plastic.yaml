  Open-source community who share instructions for creating plastic shredders,
  injectors, and sheet presses, so you can create anything you want from used
  plastic. Collect plastic from neighbors, clean it, shred it, [3D print a
  mold](https://pinshape.com/blog/low-cost-injection-molding-using-3d-printing/),
  and create anything you can imagine! You can [buy the
  machines](https://preciousplastic.com/solutions/machines/overview.html) too if
  making them is out of your wheelhouse.
