  Cracked screens, weak batteries, broken charging ports... Weâ€™d like to fix
  them, but instead we end up buying a new smartphone because repairs are too
  expensive, difficult or impossible. Reducing the lifespan of a product may
  drive sales, but this comes at the expense of consumers, workers and the
  planet. Ask the European Union to give people the Right to Repair by requiring
  manufacturers to design repairable smartphones and provide spare parts and
  repair information to all repairers and consumers.
