  Google are a long way from perfect, but Google Cloud advertises 100% renewable
  energy. They don't _just_ offset, they actually reduce the electricity usage
  too, and "strive to build the worldâ€™s most energy-efficient computing network
  by squeezing more out of every watt of power we consume." Their main rival,
  Amazon AWS, does not do that, and actively hosts oil and gas companies, who
  use the platform to find more places to dig. Switching to Google Cloud (or a
  host who in turn is on Google Cloud), is one of many ways to make your
  platform have less impact on the earth.
