description: >-
  A travel company who run sustainable trips all over the world. Sail from
  Scotland to Iceland, cycle across Vietnam, hike in Peru. Admittedly some of
  these trips will require a flight to get there, but one trip a year (or
  alternative years) is probably reasonable. At least when you get there, these
  vacations will be helping and protecting local nature, wildlife and culture.
