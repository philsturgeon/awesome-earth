  Repair Cafés are free meeting places and they’re all about repairing things
  (together). You’ll find tools and materials to help you make any repairs to
  clothes, furniture, electrical appliances, bicycles, crockery, appliances,
  toys, et cetera. You’ll also find expert volunteers, with repair skills in all
  kinds of fields. Repair your stuff, or just enjoy a coffee. They're
  world-wide, and the site is multi-lingual.
