  Make sure your makeup, biofuel, popcorn, candy, and other [various
  products](https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/palm-oil/palm-oil-free-list) are
  palm-oil free. The World Wildlife Fund estimates that 48 football fields worth
  of rainforest are cut down every minute! It’s estimated that palm oil
  plantations now cover around 27 million hectares. The forests being clear cut
  are often habitat for orangutans, who will be completely gone within 5-10
  years at this rate.
