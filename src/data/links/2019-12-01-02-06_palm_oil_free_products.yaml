  Make sure your makeup, biofuel, popcorn, candy, and other [various
  products](https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/palm-oil/palm-oil-free-list) are
  palm-oil free. The World Wildlife Fund estimates that 48 football fields worth
  of rainforest are cut down every minute! Itâ€™s estimated that palm oil
  plantations now cover around 27 million hectares. The forests being clear cut
  are often habitat for orangutans, who will be completely gone within 5-10
  years at this rate.
