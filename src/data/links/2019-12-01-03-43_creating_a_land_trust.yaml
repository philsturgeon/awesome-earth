description: >-
  A land trust is a charitable organization that acquires land or conservation
  easements, or that stewards land or easements, for conservation purposes. Land
  owners may consider designating portions of their land as a land trust, in
  order to preserve natural features in perpetuity, and be eligible for tax
  benefits as a result.
