  Fossil-fueled power plants are responsible for nearly 40 percent of Americaâ€™s
  carbon footprint. The Clean Power Plan calls for setting limits on this
  climate-warming pollution from these power plants, specifically at least 32
  percent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. By 2030, the Clean Power Plan could
  save the United States $20 billion in climate-related costs and deliver up to
  $34 billion in health benefits.
