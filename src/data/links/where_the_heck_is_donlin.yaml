  Sited deep in the Bush of Southwestern Alaska, the Donlin Gold prospect is the
  largest proposed gold mine in Alaska's history. However, an overwhelming
  majority of Alaskan residents are unfamiliar with the details of it's
  development and implications. Noting the absence of available data, as well as
  the lack of awareness surrounding the proposal, Bjorn and Kim took on the
  ground-truth-trekking model of investigative research, and set out to explore
  some of the unanswered questions from the source. Completing a three-part,
  1,000 mile human powered wilderness expedition through the proposed footprint
  of the mine, they engaged the people that they encountered on the subjects of
  perpetual waste storage, the significance of subsistence fisheries, the energy
  demands of a large-scale mine, and the challenges facing rural residents to
  name a few.
