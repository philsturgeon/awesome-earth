            Together with contributions from 50+ people, we gather resources to
            help everyone find their next piece of climate action. The climate
            crisis might be overwhelming when you start to understand the
            severity of it all, but if we can get people on board with
            simplifying their lives, reducing their footprint, offsetting the
            remaining footprint for barely any money, and reducing the insane
            amounts of waste we all cause, our kids might have a chance.
