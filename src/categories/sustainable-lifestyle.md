There are a lot of small things you can do throughout various aspects of your life to make a big impact. Don't buy as much shit. Reduce and reuse more than you recycle. Shop at farmer's markets and stores with reusable containers instead of buying plastic-wrapped nonsense from the big box stores and major supermarket chains. 

When heading into the great outdoors, learn all about the [Leave no Trace](https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/) philosophy. Call out your friends if they're not aware of the principles and cause negative impacts on the environment.
