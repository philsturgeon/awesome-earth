Everyone needs a vacation, but [overtourism](https://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/news/104207105/countries-with-the-most-tourists-per-head-of-population-destinations-suffering-overtourism) is destroying amazing places. We need to practice [sustainable tourism](https://www.fix.com/blog/sustainable-tourism/), and chose closer locations for more of our vacations.

How to get to your destination is also important.

> Flying gets a bad rap, but airplanes become more efficient the longer the flight because high-altitude flying is more efficient. In contrast, hopping onto a short-haul flight is as bad as crossing the country alone in a gas-guzzling truck. -- [fix.com](https://www.fix.com/blog/sustainable-tourism/)

For this reason, getting around most of Europe by train is the way to go. Even if trains are a little slower, it's ok because [night trains](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/04/europe-night-train-sweden-eco-travel-sleeper-car-fossil-free/586228/) have made a comeback! You can get wherever you're going while you sleep, and that's one less night in a hotel. Multi-day trips include food in the price, so you can avoid the temptation to splurge on a fancy holiday meal.

Cruises generally use diesel propulsion which contributes similar greenhouse gasses to flying, so _avoid cruises at all costs_. Whilst [some ferries are switching to electric](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/worlds-second-largest-ferry-operator-switching-from-diesel-to-batteries), most have not done that yet. Hopping on a cargo/freight ship or ferry which is already transporting a bunch of trucks means you can make hops across various ponds with minimal impact. Releasing gases at high altitude has a drastically increased warming effect, so let's bring back the transatlantic ship crossing: it will make us consider if we really need to go half way around the world for a quick vacation, or meetings which probably could have been virtual calls.
