Air pollution causes [200,000 early deaths each year in the USA](http://news.mit.edu/2013/study-air-pollution-causes-200000-early-deaths-each-year-in-the-us-0829).
Billionaires and scientists are [scaling up carbon trapping programs](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/04/carbon-emissions-negative-emissions-technologies-capture-storage-bill-gates)
with big old turbines, even looking at turning that byproduct into fuel, but those
same scientists are begging us to live less carbon intensive lives and fund
offsetting programs.

They need our help, so figure out your footprint with some of these calculators,
reduce it over time, and offset the rest. Take a look at [Reforestation](/reforestation/)
for more ways to offset.
