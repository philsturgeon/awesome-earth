Air pollution kills millions of people around the world every year. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 91 per cent of us breathe air that is unsafe and it’s the cause of 36 per cent of deaths from lung cancer, 34 per cent from stroke and 27 per cent from heart disease. Exposure to small particulates which bypass the body’s defences, penetrating deep into the respiratory system, is often to blame.

In India, [1,240,000 million people died in 2017](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-pollution-lancet/indias-polluted-air-claimed-1-24-million-lives-in-2017-study-idUSKBN1O51T8). In the USA was around [200,000 early deaths per year](http://news.mit.edu/2013/study-air-pollution-causes-200000-early-deaths-each-year-in-the-us-0829) back in 2013, but with recent EPA air quality rollbacks that number is [growing by tens of thousands](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/20/us-air-pollution-deaths-study-jama).

Billionaires and scientists are [scaling up carbon trapping programs](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/04/carbon-emissions-negative-emissions-technologies-capture-storage-bill-gates)
with big old turbines, even looking at turning that byproduct into fuel, but those
same scientists are begging us to live less carbon intensive lives and fund
offsetting programs.

They need our help, so figure out your footprint with some of these calculators,
reduce it over time, and offset the rest. Take a look at [Reforestation](/reforestation/)
for more ways to offset.
