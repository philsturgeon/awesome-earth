There are [101 ways](https://www.goingzerowaste.com/blog/101-easy-eco-friendly-zero-waste-tips) to reduce the amount of waste you produce, which is important for many reasons. The average American generates 4 pounds of waste a day. There are 319,000,000 people in the US. That’s 1,276,000,000 pounds of discarded material a day. All of that needs to be collected by heavy-ass inefficient trucks, sorted, incinerated, or put in landfills, all of which have their own awful impacts on the environment.

Recycling is not the answer either. For years 70% of the worlds plastic was being sold to China, but now [they aren't taking it](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/03/13/702501726/where-will-your-plastic-trash-go-now-that-china-doesnt-want-it).

Other types of waste are a problem too. In the U.S, [40% of food is thrown out](https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/wasted-food-IP.pdf). Scotland produces [456,000 tonnes of food waste](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-48257019) a year compared to 224,000 tonnes of plastic waste. [France set up a "ban" on food waste](https://foodtank.com/news/2019/06/opinion-frances-ban-on-food-waste-three-years-later/) to reduce this through tax incentives and other means, putting them at the top of the [Food Sustainability Index](http://foodsustainability.eiu.com/heat-map/), but in most countries the majority of food waste goes into landfills. Landfills are [the third largest source of methane emissions](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill_gas) in the United States, and methane has a twenty five times stronger heat-trapping effect than CO2.

Focusing on refusing, reducing, and reusing, will do much more good for the climate.
