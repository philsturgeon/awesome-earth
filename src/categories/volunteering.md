Wherever you are in the world there's something you can do. Research local land trusts or land management organizations to see if they need help. You can help maintain woodlands, eradicate invasive species, and monitor deforestation. Even just going for a hike on popular trails to collect rubbish can stop wildlife dying from eating plastic. Walking along any stretch of beach you'll find plenty of trash, and stop it going out to join the [Great Pacific Garbage Patch](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/great-pacific-garbage-patch/) or [North Atlantic Garbage Patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_garbage_patch).

Research your local "Gleaners" network, to go to farms and pick the "second harvest" (i.e slightly bruised but edible food) to reduce food waste and help bolster food banks.

You don't need to fly to the Seychelles for a week of volunteering to pick up litter, those "Go Abroad" programs just encourage flying around and that ruins the impact you're having on the world.

Here are a few more specific ideas.
