intro: Figure out how big your carbon footprint is, so you can reduce it.

Every person in the world has their own carbon footprint, which is the total amount of carbon dioxide you've emitted either directly, like driving to the shops, or indirectly, like buying something online which means somebody else is doing the driving to bring you your stuff. 

Americans have the highest carbon footprint in the world, where people are spewing 15-20 tonnes of CO2 into the air every year. It varies a lot by country, but the E.U. average is around 7 tonnes. If we want to stick to 2°C then we need to each get our footprints down to 4.8 tonnes. 2°C is still abslutely awful (global food shortages and 98% of coral bleached which means the oceans are fucked and a lot of fish are gone), but 3°C means billions die. Right now we're heading for 4°C so we really do need to get on top of this.

For context, one return flight from London to New York is 1-2 tonnes, a meat-based diet is 2.6 tonnes, and driving a car for a year is around 2.6 tonnes as well. Then there's buying stuff like laptops and other electronics which produce almost as much CO2 as short haul flight. 😨 These averages may not apply to you, maybe you're doing better, or worse! A calculator you can get more accurate insight, to congratulate you or motivate you to sort things out.

Once you've got a calculator that works for you, check out our [Carbon Reduction](/carbon-reduction) section to keep trimming it down until you get to 2 tonnes, then 1, then... 0?!
