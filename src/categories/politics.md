Climate action should not be partisan, as if your interests are in economic growth, job opportunities, [personal good health](https://www.theinvadingsea.com/2018/03/01/if-you-live-in-florida-doctors-say-climate-change-is-already-affecting-your-health/), avoiding the [disproportionate impacts to those living in poverty](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/31/climate-change-poor-suffer-most-un-report), [home values](https://www.theinvadingsea.com/2018/04/30/the-risk-of-sea-level-rise-is-chipping-away-at-miami-home-values-new-research-shows/), everyone should care.

Individuals can do everything right in their own lives, even help inspire people
around them, but there is a limit to a single persons ability to effect change.
Governments and authorities can increase the scale of solutions through
legislation, subsidies, taxes, and prosecution, but they won't bother unless we
make a lot of noise. Many elected officials are busy focusing on re-election,
personal enrichment, or [just don't really care](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senators-launch-bipartisan-climate-change-initiative-n1070286).

The whole idea of a democracy is that politicians are responsible for enacting the will of the people. This doesn't always happen, but participating in the process [can make a huge difference](https://www.nrdc.org/onearth/good-news-public-lands-no-really).
